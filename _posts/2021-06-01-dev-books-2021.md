So, I thought I'd share some details about the collection of reference books
that I have accumulated over the last year or so. These are quite handy to have
and help me become a better software developer. I also think its important to
be aware of best practices, and take a step back to learn about topics that are outside
your normal work.

So here goes!

1. C++ Primer (5th Edition) by Lipman et al. - A great book for beginner and intermediate level C++
engineers. The book covers most fundamental concepts in detail, and has a really good set of excercises
and problems that will get you started right away. Although it doesn't go much into the powerful aspects
of modern C++, it covers the language essentials in good detail.
