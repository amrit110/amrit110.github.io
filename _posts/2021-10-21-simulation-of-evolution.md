*Disclaimer*: This is a random idea, and more of an excercise in writing out abstract thoughts
than an attempt at writing a technical post.

One of the key branches of science that I find myself reading, is that of 
natural history and theory of evolution. I suppose that after Darwin's era, the
curiousity to understand our origins, by unmasking the origins of other life forms has
vastly diminished. Today, we all accept Darwin's theory and have essentially accepted
our fate as the immediate relatives of apes and chimps in the evolutionary ladder.
We find comfort in nature's extraordinary ability to create diverse life.

Yet, this ability is understood in a very narrow sense. The sheer timescale over
which life evolved is something we humans cannot comprehend and truly appreciate. 
The earliest traces of organic life (proteins and enzymes) goes back 4.6 billion years
in time. That is 7 orders of magnitude more than the number of years which we humans are
used to comprehend (i.e. 10 raised to the power of 9 vs 100). There are a couple of
interesting implications for us that arise from this incomprehensible time-scale.
One, we simply cannot fathom the complexity of the mechanisms that emerged out of 
the interactions between the building blocks of life, because this time-scale is too large and 
a fine-grained inspection is a gargantuan task. 

Let's consider an example. Just think about all the different forms of mammals, and the differences in their appearance. The 
different colors and thicknesses of fur, length of their noses, puffiness of their tails,
length of their spines or necks and whether they would have paws or hooves or toes. Its a
combinatorial explosion. Yet, each of these features evolved steadily over several generations,
and several iterations of natural selection mechanisms, including migration, mutations and other
environmental factors. This gradual, yet smooth transition from one species to another,
creating and expanding the branches of life, is not an easy concept to visualise and 
truly understand. Just think of the different colors and patterns on butterflies,
and how they might have evolved. For every species of butterfly like the famous monarch butterfly, with whom we have the pleasure
of co-inhabiting the earth today, we have lost several not-so-monarchy colored butterflies to natural selection.
When i think about this, I can't help feel that, with all the technology we 
have at our disposal today, we yet don't have an intuitive way to process these evolutionary dynamics.
The information is also spread out over several billions of years. 

However, there are some fundamental hierarchies to this information. 
Using those hierarchies could be very useful to understand how to
represent the information in a way that could be more intuitive. For example, the famous shroedinger's cat 
thought experiment made everyone easily understand a complex concept in quantum mechanics i.e. the idea that
a particle could exist in two states simultaneously until a measurement is made, revealing its actual state. 
Even though this understanding isn't deep, it is a powerful idea
that with the right representation, even the most complex of ideas can be explained.

Hence, a key implication is that in order to better understand this complexity and push
the horizons of our understanding of natural history and evolution, we need a visual
tool. We need an aid that can help overcome our current inability to visualise in our minds, such a
complex chain network of interactions. We need a visual tool that can show one species
gradually transform into another, how its phenotypic features morph due to selection pressure.
This tool satisfying our artistic cravings, essential to providing a complete understanding of a concept.
The visual output if rendered in 3 dimensions or through virtual reality headsets, would present
a deep and rich understanding, and potentially lead to the discovery of insights 
with broader and higher levels of abstraction. One example of a very simplistic version
of such a tool is [evolution-simuator](https://labs.minutelabs.io/evolution-simulator).
